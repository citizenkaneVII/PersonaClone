PersonaClone Readme

The goal is to creat code that will allow the different objects in the scene to interact in a way that is similar
to Persona 4.  This will include:



Levels
    -A dungeon entrance Level.  This will feature a fixed camera that follows the players movements,
        but does not move it's self.  The Entrance will feature a point the player can approch,
        click on and enter.

    -A dungeon level.  This is where the player starts and can move around.  In the
        dungeon state, the player can move around, attack/be attacked by the enemy,
        and open treasure chests.

    -A battlefield level that is only entered when either the player or the ememy
        attacks successfully first.  The two objects will exchange attack until one
        or the other dies.  If the player dies, Game Over.  If the player wins, they
        will be returned to the dungeon level and allowed to enter the Endlevel
        check point.


Chracters
    -A Player using WASD keys for direction in a 3d space

    -Enemies that wander.  Chase is activated when player get's close.
        The enemy will try to atack the player before the player can
        attack it.  Depending on who attacks first will determin if the
        battle starts with a Player Advantage, Enemy Advantage, or Neither.
        (Use case or if/then statements)  There will be three.  The first two won't 
        be too hard, but the last will be the Boss with more hp, powerful attack, etc.


GameObjects (Non AI objects that can be interacted with)
    -A treasure chest that opens when the player clicks on it.
        It will give the player a power up that can be used in the Battlefield state.

    -Doors, bring player to next part of the level

    -Dungeon save/check point

    -End Level check point


UI
    -Health Bar

    -Enemy Health Bar

    -Attack Menu

    -Game over screen

    -Interactive popups:
            treasure, dungeon entrance, door, checkpoint

    -Victory screen




We'll need a lot of code scripts for these.  All the things we have to program:
    -Level Manager
    -UI/interaction
    -Enemy AI
    -Character Controller
    -Interaction for doors, treasure (OpenObject)
    -Potion
    -Savepoint
    -Gameover conditions (win or loose)



The Battlefield will be the most difficult to program.  The enemies will be able to attack.  The Boss will be able to attack and recover.
The Player will be able to attack, escape, and use item (the only item option will be a potion).
