PersonaClone Readme

The goal is to creat code that will allow the different objects in the scene to interact in a way that is similar
to Persona 4.  This will include:

-A dungeon level.  This is where the player starts and can move around.  In the
    dungeon state, the player can move around, attack/be attacked by the enemy,
    and open treasure chests.

-A battlefield level that is only entered when either the player or the ememy
    attacks successfully first.  The two objects will exchange attack until one
    or the other dies.  If the player dies, Game Over.  If the player wins, they
    will be returned to the dungeon level and allowed to enter the Endlevel
    check point.

-A Player using WASD keys for direction in a 3d space

-Enemy that wanders.  Chase is activated when player get's close.
    The enemy will try to atack the player before the player can
    attack it.  Depending on who attacks first will determin if the
    battle starts with a Player Advantage, Enemy Advantage, or Neither.
    (Use case or if/then statements)

-A treasure chest that opens when the player clicks on it.
    It will give the player a power up that can be used in the Battlefield state.

-UI featuring health, enemie's health, aquirement of items, and battlefield options

-End Level Check point
